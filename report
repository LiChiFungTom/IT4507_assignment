Assignment Report In addition to the system development，you are required to write up a Short Report covers following sections：
1. Assumptions regarding the problem context
  有咩前設/預設( user input 咩地方唔用得 )

   First the system can display all products in list and can change value in list
   such as price , quality , price , cost.
   Second , the system can check the user input which is can't input valus.For example 
   the product_ID can't input again.Also the user only can input correct data type value. Such as
   the product_ID should be input a number, name should be a string.
   Third, the user only can do something before the user undo and redo the command.For example, if user star using the
   system, input the undo  command , the system will get them a remind(nothing to undo), else the user already did something 
   ,then they can do the undo command.One the other hand, the redo command is same logic with undo command.
   

2. Application design with class diagram
  大圖 之後 用細圖 之後解釋


3. Discussion and explanation on each of the design patterns applied to the application 
   class用黎做咩 / methods

4. User Guide 
  說明書
   
   User can input a command(c,d,p,s,u,r,l,x)
   
   When User input c command:
   Than will ask the user which one should be create and that input a string(ro/rc)
   user input ro , it will create a Robot product ,otherwise user input rc,it will create
   Remote Control Car.
   
   User input d command:
   System will ask the user display which product(*/ product_ID)
   If the user input a *,
   It will be display all the toy products such as price,name,ID,quantity, other infor,cost
   
   If the user input a product_ID,
   It will be display the information of the product such as price,name,id,quantity,height/Maxspeed,cost.
  




   User input p command:

   The system ask the user input the product_ID(which one they want to change)
   And that ask them what quantity to be purchased ,what cost is purchasing.
   When finish all the will print a result which they are changed.

   User input s command:
   
   The system will ask for user to input the product_id ,what quantity should to sold and the price selling for.
   When the user finish input all the value , it will should the result which is the user already change.

   User input u command:

   The system undo one command which is system already do command. If the user didn't anything before,they system will 
   get a remind.For example , user input u when just start began user the system , the system will output a remind
   (Nothing to undo).

   User input r command:

   The system will redo one command system which is the system already undo a command.If the user didn't undo a command but the user input 
   r command the system will output a remind(nothing to redo).

   User input l command:

   The system will list out all the undo list and redo list.If the list is empty ,it will display empty otherwise 
   it will display the list of redo or undo list.

   User input x command:

   The system will exit .

   
   

5. Test Plan and Test Cases
